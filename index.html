        <h5>In the novel "No Longer Human", Dazai uses this book to describe his personal
            unattached view at the society he lives in. Dazai, being born in a aristocratic
            family while being influenced by western culture, felt like he wasn't human compared 
            to that of his faimily or people around him in his school.

    <div class="review">
        This novel is highly reccomended to those who feel like they might be detached from society, 
        or people interested in the struggle of someone who grew up differently. I would give this novel
        a solid 4.5/5 due to it's complex and diverse vocabulary and amazing narrative all the way through.
